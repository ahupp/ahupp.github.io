For my birthday celebration last year I did something a little different: a [Birthday
Challenge](http://www.birthdaychallenge.com).  What is a Birthday Challenge?

Last year's challenge (my first) consisted of a 26Km run, 26 pullups and 2.6L of beer.   For this year's challenge I've 
decided to run a marathon, which has been a long-term goal of mine.  I've signed up for the [San Francisco Marathon](http://www.runsfm.com) this July 29th.  This is great for a few reasons: this distance aligns with my age (26.2 miles vs 27 years), the date almost falls on my birthday, and I'll by living in the Bay Area this summer.

I haven't yet decided what all of the events will be for this year but it will probably include another physical challenge and some kind of eating or drinking.  Wish me luck!
