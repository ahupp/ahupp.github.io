Hello!  I'm a software engineer living in Chapel Hill, NC.  You can find out more about me <a href="http://hupp.org/adam/about" title="Adam Hupp - About Me">here</a>.     I'll be writing about the projects I'm working on (mostly software) and anything else I find exciting.

The name of the blog is inspired by this quote:
<blockquote> In the long run, every program becomes rococo, and then rubble.
-- Alan Perlis</blockquote>
