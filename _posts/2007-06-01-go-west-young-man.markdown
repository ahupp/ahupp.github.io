Erin and I have arrived in Berkeley, completing our NC to CA cross-country road trip.  We'll be staying here this summer for Erin's internship in the Bay Area.  The drive out was great, with stops in [Wisconsin](http://flickr.com/photos/hupp/509483275/in/set-72157600244219455/), Minnesota, [Badlands National Park (SD)](http://flickr.com/photos/hupp/509461092/in/set-72157600244219455/),  Colorado,  [Arches National Park (UT)](http://flickr.com/photos/hupp/509515221/in/set-72157600244219455/), [Mono Lake (CA)](http://flickr.com/photos/hupp/509526966/in/set-72157600244219455/) and [Yosemite National Park](http://flickr.com/photos/hupp/509557397/in/set-72157600244219455/).
