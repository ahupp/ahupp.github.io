This weekend I attended my first [Maker Faire](http://makerfaire.com/) and was amazed at the
variety of cool stuff to be seen.  I'm sure every attendee has their own list of highlights, but here's mine:

[TechShop](http://techshop.ws/): The TechShop provides access to tools beyond the reach of the average hobbyist.  Welding, CNC plasma cutters, later etching, and machine tools are all available after a short training class and payment of a modest use fee.  I can't even explain how excited I am to check this place out - I'll be taking the TIG welding class at the end of May.

[Electric Unicycle](http://www.tlb.org/eunicycle.html): The was probably the coolest single thing I saw.  It sounds deceptively simple: a unicycle with an electric motor.  The neat thing is that, like a Segway, it (sort of) self balances and is controlled by the
operator leaning forward and backwards.  

[Orb Swarm](http://orbswarm.com/): A 3' diameter hollow sphere that can roll along the ground under autonomous control.  A motor is suspended in side the sphere, and it changes direction by tilting the batteries to act as a counterweight.

[Michael Cooper's Chair](http://michaelcooper.us/): This item was sort of out of place at the fair in that, as far as I could tell, it didn't actually do anything.  Even so it was easily the most beautiful and polished piece I saw.  The chair is made of curved wood laminate and is set in the middle of a spider/helicopter/hydraulic lift device right out of science fiction.

Unfortunately Mr. Cooper's website follows the common artistic failing of using unlinkable Flash applets to display their portfolio so I can't link directly to the piece.  The item I saw is shown in the upper-right hand corner on the main page of his website.
