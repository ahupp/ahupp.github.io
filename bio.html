<h2>about me</h2>
<p>I was born in 1980 on a farm in southern Michigan.  From there I
lived in a variety of midwestern cities before landing in Madison, WI
to attend the <a href="http://www.wisc.edu">University of
Wisconsin-Madison</a>.  At Madison I obtained a degree in Computer
Sciences and spent an inordinate amount of time in
the <a href="http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu">Undergraduate Projects
Lab</a>.</p>

<p>Soon, my old friend Erin re-entered my life after a trip abroad and
we began dating.  When she enrolled in a graduate program in Chapel
Hill, NC I decided to leave the comforts of Madison and join her in
North Carolina.  We were married in June of 2006.</p>

<p>In 2008 we moved to San Francisco, where I'm am engineer at
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Engineering">Facebook</a>.  We have
two adorable children, Ada and Eliza, and two obnoxious cats.</p>
